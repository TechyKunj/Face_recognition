# 🌟 Face Recognition Project 🌟

This project demonstrates a simple face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib. The code captures frames from the primary camera and detects faces in real-time, drawing rectangles around them and numbering each detected face.

## Prerequisites
Before running this code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

OpenCV (cv2) 🎥
Dlib 🧙
NumPY 🔢
  
You can conjure these libraries using the magic spell of pip:
bash
pip install opencv-python dlib numpy

## How it Works
The code captures frames from the primary camera using OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture).

It uses Dlib's face detector to identify faces in the frames.

For each detected face, it draws a green rectangle around it and numbers each face.
